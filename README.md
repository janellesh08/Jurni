# Jurni
A progress tracking web application.



## Description
Jurni was created to assist anyone who wants to embark on whatever new path they chose by allowing them to document their progress for each journey within one space. 
Users can start a new journey, or a journal of steps taken, milestones, and growth while learning a new skill. Once a journey is started within the application, users can 
enter journal entries as text, videos, or pictures do document their progress along the way. A journey can be for a certain amount of time or it can be 
lifelong. It can be for whatever the user would like such as a wellness journey, a fitness journey, a healthy hair journey or breaking habits like smoking. The purpose
is to motivate users to start and keep up with their progress while creating a look back to when they first started all the way to end of their journey. 



## Motivation
I am someone who is always on a new journey. I am starting new courses and learning new skills as well as creating new goals for myself. I often document my progress
using social media but there are so many platforms to keep up with and my journeys are spread accross them all in some way, shape or form. I got the idea to create 
Jurni because I wanted a centralized location for all of these specific journeys where I could store all my videos and pictures as well as include my thoughts and my
mental state at any point along the way. I know how valuable it can be to have a visual of ones progress. Jurni is what it is so that we can be best version of ourselves.
